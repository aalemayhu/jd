# jd

A static website to list out the Japanese days in a week. 

This project was bootstraped using the template at https://github.com/sveltejs/template.

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
yarn # npm install
yarn dev # npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see the app running.
Edit a file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
yarn build # npm run build
```
